# PacketSender v2.0
This program uses the UDP Packet system in C# to send packets to a specified IP address. Using this software requires **extremely** good internet (over 50,000 upload and download), so unless you have a botnet there is no use in using this. Still, enjoy the code :)

# Note:
DDoSing people/websites is illegal. I will not get involved in any legal issues if you choose to use this code unethically.
